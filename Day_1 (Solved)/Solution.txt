Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

// --------------------------------------------------------
Solution 1:
    Calculate with sum of each pair of number with target in list
    -> number of calculate = C2(n) = n * (n-1) / 2 ~ On2
    Complexity: On2

Solution 2:
    Sort array -> using two pointer

Solution 3: 
    Using hashtable
